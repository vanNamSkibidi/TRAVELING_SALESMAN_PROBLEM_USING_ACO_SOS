    This local optimization strategy is used to improve the solution quality searched by SOS–ACO and accelerate
    the convergence rate.
    Idea: Given a TSP instance of size n, an HC is denoted as HC = (v1, v2, . . . , vn), where vi is one of the n cities and i represents
    the position of city vi in HC. There are two steps for improving an HC using the local optimization strategy.\n
            Step 1: For each city vk in an HC, find the city vk' which is nearest to vk in the following cities. As shown in Eq. (9), dis(vi
    , vj) is the distance between vi and vj
            Step 2: Reverse the path between vk and vk' so that vk is adjacent to vk'. If the adjusted path is shorter than the original path, the adjusted path is preserved. Otherwise, the original path
    is maintained.
